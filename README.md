# Flood Prediction Using KNN: Analysis of Kerala Flood Dataset

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a flood prediction model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Kerala flood dataset. The model predicts the likelihood of flooding in various regions based on historical flood data and meteorological variables, providing an accurate tool for early flood detection and prevention.
